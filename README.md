# Silent Failure in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in asynchronous Dart code where exceptions are not properly handled, leading to silent failures.  The `bug.dart` file shows the issue: a `catch` block handles the exception but doesn't rethrow it, preventing higher-level functions from reacting to the error.

The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a solution: by explicitly rethrowing the exception using `rethrow`, the error properly propagates to the `main` function, allowing for appropriate error handling.

This is a crucial detail often overlooked in asynchronous programming.
